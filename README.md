# Overview

This is a project that I have been wanting to get started on for a very long time
It's essentially my first take on creating an actual game.

The reason I made this game is because I want to get into more advanced game development and starting with a simple 3d movement game with audio seemed like a great start to me.

The unity files themselves are not in this build due to the sheer lack of uploading in time, causing files to not go up, so this is just the build of the project for playing.

Controls are simple, wasd to move around and mouse to look around.

To see what the project looks like in the editor, take a look at the software demo video
